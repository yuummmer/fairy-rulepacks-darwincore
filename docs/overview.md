# Darwin Core (DwC) – FAIRy community rulepacks

This repo contains community-maintained Darwin Core rulepacks and small demo fixtures for FAIRy.

## What’s included

- **dwc_starter**: a beginner-friendly rulepack with a small set of high-signal checks that apply to many DwC occurrence-style tables.
- **Demo fixture**: a tiny OBIS-derived occurrence extract (SF Bay Area, *Mytilus californianus*) used to demonstrate report output.
- **Scripts**: reproducible scripts for generating/inspecting the demo dataset.
- **Docs**: a short guide on how to read FAIRy reports.

## Start here

- How to read FAIRy reports: `docs/how-to-read-fairy-reports.md`
- Example run: `docs/examples/obis-occurrence.md`

## Roadmap

- Add a sampling-event rulepack (`dwc_sampling_event`) for Event core ↔ Occurrence extension datasets.
